\section{OOD detection in multi-label setting}
As mentioned previously, research on detecting Out-Of-Distribution in multi-label classifiers has quite recently just begun, 
resulting in a limited number of approaches. 
A few of the used methods adopt concepts and notions from multi-class OOD detection. 
In this section, we will provide a more detailed overview description of state-of-the-art OOD detectors in multi-label setting.
